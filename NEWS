   This is mainly bug fixing/stabilization release, with several interesting things:
   Objective C syntax hl support.
   C/C++, Pascal highlighting improvement.
   The "Search in files" function now scan also PDF and DJVU (if TEA built with the needed libraries).
   Enhanced font rendering mode.

   Stay tuned.
