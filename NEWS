TEA 49.0.0, november 2019
---------------------------------------
  
   THE INNER CHANGES

   In this version I rewrote the many portions of the core code that is related to the containers (i.e. data arrays). The files lists, the syntax highlighting rules, etc. - almost all those things are re-implemented from Qt library containers to STL library containers. Also, the magic Qt's macro "foreach" was eliminated from TEA code. It makes TEA ready for the upcoming Qt 6 and simplify to maintain code between Qt 4, 5 and 6.
   The Qt 4 compatibility is still important for TEA because of OS/2, Slackware and old distros.
   The containers question caused line by line review of the code. I've found some ancient errors and fixed them. Some stuff has been improved and added.

  


   Stay tuned.
