TEA 62.0.1, November 2022

   From the dawn of the humanity I've heard that TEA's interface is obscure. And I know why - due to the built-in file manager that is used by default instead of the traditional file save/open dialogs. TEA all that time has such dialogs, but they are turned off by default.
   Now, in the sake of the user-friendliness, behold! The file save/open dialogs are turned on by default, when you start TEA in a first time. For all old users things remains the same as has been.
   Beside this new outstanding feature, TEA 62 has all copy/paste stuff rewritten from the ground to avoid the strange clipboard interaction at some Qt 6.x release

   Stay tuned.
