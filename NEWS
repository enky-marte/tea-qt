=====NEWS ABOUT TEA====
TEA 50.0.0, november 2019
---------------------------------------

   VISIBLE

   Meet the new, alternative Docked interface. Switch between two UI's using Tune::Interface::UI Mode - Classic/Docked. With the Docked one, you can move FIF and Logmemo freely inside or outside the main window.
   Another new option is Tune::Interface::UI Language list, which come instead of the removed "Override locale" option.  
   All those options requires to restart TEA to be applied.

   UNDER THE HOOD

   Some parts of TEA now work faster due to iterator-based cycles optimization.
   The Windows-specific module (with the local server) for the "single application" mode has been removed, now TEA uses shared memory based module for all systems excepting OS/2. So QtNetwork dependency has been dropped.

    TEA RELEASE URL

   Note for the package maintainers - fresh TEA releases now available at github:
https://github.com/psemiletov/tea-qt/releases
   The traditional good old almost hand-made tarballs from semiletov.org and tea.ourproject.org were be sacrificed to the unification and modern frameworks.

   OTHER CHANGES/FIXES

* cmake's make dist creates tarball with dirname as at github, i.e. tea-qt-<ver>
* code cleanup after cppcheck advices



   Stay tuned.
