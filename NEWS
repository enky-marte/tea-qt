   After a long gap here is a new release, with all know bugs fixed, especially the syntax highlighting stuff. With such fixes, I can develop TEA further, based on this stable release. Almost each line of the code was reviewed.
   But, what's new? 
   On Linux, you can use the joystick to move cursor keys (this function is turned off by default and can be enabled via Tune - Common).
   The recent list and bookmarks now saved the word wrap settings.
   "Sum by last column" - can evaluate expressions and knows comments.
   And more :)


   Stay tuned.
