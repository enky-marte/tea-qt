   After the major 46 release, a lot of bugs were revealed. I was suprised that TEA lost the Qt 4.x compatibility, so it was fixes now, among the important fix for syntax highligting engine (Qt 4.x version). Thanks to Slackware where I can test it.
   Another fix is related to Logmemo scripting, so the "log" function works again (can be called from JavaScript). 
   The IDE part of 46.1 adds some Objective C stuff (syntax hl, header/source switch).

   Stay tuned.
