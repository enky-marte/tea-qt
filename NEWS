   Hello world!
   This version fixes all stuff related to external processes when TEA is compiled against Qt6.
   Some bundled Quazip fixes has been made. 
   Also TEA features user-defined virtual keyboards for quick mouse-type letters or whole words. See the Manual about "Keyboards", and the "View" menu.

   Stay tuned.
