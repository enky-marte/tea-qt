=====NEWS ABOUT TEA====
TEA 60.0.0, march 2021
---------------------------------------

   For the centuries of the development, TEA gains a thousands of features. Some of them becomes rarely used, some needs more dependencies, so I've decide to make a some sort of clean-up without the actual removing of such functions. Now they are just disabled by default at the build level, when you compile TEA with cmake and meson. The qmake subsystem still loves all TEA non-mandatory deps. 
   So, by default, with meson and cmake, TEA does not searches and does not builds with: QML, Aspell, libpopplerqt5, ddjvuapi. You can enable all that stuff (see README) by yourself manually. I don't know the decisions of packagers, their choice of TEA features, now I'm speaking just about the build from the source.
   TEA 50.1 also has a lot of fixes for Clang/Mac. 
   My study of Voynich manuscript (the dead end, it is impossible to read it) lead me to add some new functions:
+ Functions - Analysis - UNITAZ sorting length
+ Functions - Filter - Filter by repetitions
+ Functions - Sort - Sort by length

   Stay tuned.
