   Hello world!

   This version is cool in many reasons. 
   All inner XML parsing has been moved to pugixml instead of Qt's XML parser. I feel that pugixml is faster and more useful for TEA. XML parsing is used at some text formats support (such as FB2, ODT, etc.) and the syntax highlighting engine, so all that stuff was heavy rewritten. 
   To deal with complex file names, new TEA used a new format for the bookmarks and the "Recent" list. The bookmarks file will be converted to the new format automatically, and - TEA uses now a different file to hold bookmarks. The Recent list will be updated by opening files.
   New option: Tune - Functions - Misc - Show ebooks fine. It adds spaces before each paragraph, when you open FB2, Epub, etc.


   Stay tuned.
