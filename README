===INTRO===

TEA is a text editor with the hundreds of features.

===INSTALLATION FROM THE SOURCE===

You can install TEA from the source by 4 ways, using build systems qmake/make, meson/ninja, cmake/make, cmake/ninja. But first, you need to install some development libraries.

Mandatory:

Qt 4 or 5 
zlib

Optional:

libaspell (for spell checking engine)
libhunspell (for spell checking engine)
poppler-qt5 (to read the text from PDF)
ddjvuap (to read the text from DJVU)

Note for FreeBSD users: you need the pkgconf package - pkg install pkgconf


If you want to build and install TEA with cmake + make, run at the source dir:

mkdir b
cd b
cmake ..
make
make install (as root or with sudo)


To build and install TEA with cmake/ninja and GCC, do:

mkdir b
cd b
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
ninja install


To build and install TEA with meson/ninja and GCC, do:


mkdir b
meson --buildtype=release b
cd b
ninja
ninja install

To build and install TEA with meson/ninja and CLANG, do:

mkdir b
CC=clang CXX=clang++ meson --buildtype=release b
cd b
ninja
ninja install


With qmake it is even more simplier:

qmake
make
make install (as root or with sudo)


To make some source configuration (with qmake), use CONFIG variable at qmake command line parameter. For example:

qmake "CONFIG+=useclang" "CONFIG+=noaspell"

You can use some values:

nosingleapp - do not build TEA with the single application mode support
nodesktop - do not install desktop files and icons
useclang - TEA will be compiled with Clang.
noaspell - disable the Aspell (if you have it installed, but  do not want to compile TEA with Aspell support)
nohunspell - disable Hunspell for TEA.
usepoppler - use libpoppler-qt5 or qt4 for PDF text layer import. DISABLED by default
usedjvu - use libdjvulibre to read DJVU files text (read only). DISABLED by default
noprinter - disable printing support

Notes:

1. If you have installed both Qt4 and Qt5, use the qmake from Qt4 or Qt5 to configure TEA with exact version of QT. The common solution is to make symlink to qmake from Qt5 and name it qmake5, then use qmake5 instead of the usual qmake.

2. If the context menus in TEA are not localized, install the qttranslations package from your distro's repository.

3. With cmake, there are no way to disable some TEA features manually - they will be compiled if TEA found the libs those needed.

/*
Basic snippet for Ubuntu users (Qt5 build) - run this from Terminal at the TEA source directory (unpacked):

sudo apt-get install g++ pkg-config
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libaspell-dev libhunspell-dev
sudo apt-get install qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools
sudo apt-get install libqt5qml5 libqt5quick5 qtdeclarative5-dev
qmake
make
sudo make install


Snippet for Ubuntu users (Qt4 build):

sudo apt-get install g++ pkg-config
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libaspell-dev libhunspell-dev
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev qt4-dev-tools
qmake
make
sudo make install
*/


===NOTE FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS===

1. TEA after the compilation is a single binary file (with embedded resources). 

2. For the qmake build, to override the default installation path (/usr/local, with binary at /usr/local/bin) use:

qmake PREFIX=your_path
make
make install

3. cmake vs qmake vs meson. TEA's qmake project file is rather old and obscure, but it will be supported forever because it works well with Qt 4 and Qt 5. Use of meson or cmake build system is a modern way to build TEA. I use meson internally, but TEA's cmake stuff more mature.


===NOTE FOR UBUNTU USERS===

User defined hotkeys may not work due to Qt5 and Unity global menu feature. To remove global menu support in Qt5 apps, do 

sudo apt-get autoremove appmenu-qt5

or, if you want to remove also GTK global menus, use:

sudo apt-get autoremove appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt5

===DONATE===

If you want to support TEA via donation, better give your support to the Ukrainian dog shelter Lyubas House - http://lyubas.pp.ua. There are lot of dogs with disabilities, and they need help more than TEA. To donate via PayPal, please see http://www.ukraineanimalrescue.org/#!lyubas-house/cxfj. Please specify "For Lyubas's House" in the comments of donation, because there are other projects uses that PayPal account.

Ежели вы хотите как-то поддержать разработку TEA денежно, лучше поддержите киевский приют для собак Дом Любчика - http://lyubas.pp.ua. Любчик - это пёс на инвалидной коляске. У него много друзей, которым всегда нужна помощь.
